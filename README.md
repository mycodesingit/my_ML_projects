# Project - Trade&Ahead
Analyze the stocks data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.
Skills and Tools: EDA, Kmeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Cluster Profiling

# Project -  ReneWind
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.
Skills and Tools: Up and downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter tuning

# Project - EasyVisa
Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.
